# Diwali-Sales-Jupyter-Notebook-

Project Overview
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of sales data collected during the Diwali festival period. By leveraging Python's data analysis libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we will explore patterns, trends, and insights within the dataset to uncover valuable business intelligence.

Objectives
Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers in the dataset.
Transform data into suitable formats for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Summarize key statistical measures of the dataset.
Visualize data distributions and relationships using appropriate plots.
Identify trends, patterns, and correlations among variables.
Sales Performance Analysis:
Analyze overall sales performance during the Diwali period.
Compare sales figures with previous years (if available).
Identify top-selling product categories and individual products.
Customer Segmentation:
Segment customers based on demographics, purchase behavior, or other relevant criteria.
Analyze customer segments to identify preferences and spending patterns.
Marketing Insights:
Identify effective marketing channels and campaigns.
Analyze customer acquisition and retention metrics.
Provide recommendations for targeted marketing strategies.
Dataset
The project will utilize a dataset containing information about sales during the Diwali festival. The dataset is expected to include the following attributes:

Date of sale
Product details (ID, category, price)
Customer information (ID, demographics, location)
Sales amount
Payment method
Marketing channel
